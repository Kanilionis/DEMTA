    <h2>BENEFITS OF MEMBERSHIP</h2>
    <ul className="benefits">
     <li>DEMTA teachers enjoy the benefit of monthly teacher-enrichment programs.</li>

     <li>Students of DEMTA teachers enjoy numerous performance opportunities, both private and public, and the many benefits described below. </li>
    </ul>

<br></br>
<ul className="about-list">
<li><strong>RECITALS</strong>
<br></br>
Each year, students have many occasions to perform in a recital setting on DEMTAs own Mason & Hamlin piano.  This professional 7-foot grand piano was purchased in 2002 through special fundraisers and gifts, including a grant from the Scientific Cultural Facilities District. DEMTA can now offer students the unique and special opportunity to experience their best performance on an exceptionally high-quality instrument.</li>
<br></br>
<li><strong>COMMUNITY SERVICE</strong>
<br></br>
DEMTA has a very active community connection.  Our partners in the community enjoy student and teacher performances throughout the year.  Find out where is DEMTA is performing in your community on our Events Calendar. Partners we have worked with in the community include Parker Adventist Hospital, the Parker Library, Tagawa’s Nursery, Chik-Fil-A, Crosswalk bookstore, and many others.  Community events allow students to experience a very different and enriching type of service-oriented performance experience.</li>
<br></br>
<li><strong>SCHOLARSHIPS</strong>
<br></br>
DEMTA provides scholarships to qualified students for use at summer music camps, lessons and other music enrichment programs.</li>
<br></br>
<li><strong>FESTIVAL</strong>
<br></br>
Each spring, DEMTA sponsors a highly anticipated Music Festival, complete with professional adjudication, theory examinations, and sight reading tests. Students practice and prepare all year for Festival and are rewarded with medals and special concerts. The top performers are selected to perform in one of four public Honors Concerts. There are over 300 students who participate each year.</li>
<br></br>
<li><strong>CLEF AWARD</strong>
<br></br>
New to DEMTA, the CLEF Award is the Culminating Long-term Excellence at Festival Award given to students who earn a rating of 1- or higher at festival.  This award is achieved by earning 1's at festival for three, five and seven years. This program started in 2014. 2016 will be the first year students can be awarded a plaque.</li>
<br></br>
<li><strong>PERFORMANCE AWARD PROGRAM</strong>
<br></br>
In 2004, the Douglas Elbert Music Teachers Association instituted a Performance Award Program to encourage and recognize students who make an effort to perform – particularly in DEMTA sponsored recitals, festivals and community events.  Since its establishment there has been a dramatic increase in the number of students participating in all of these events. The current Performance Awards Chair is Clover Longway.
<br></br>
  <ul className="performance-points">
    <li>Students need 10 performance points to win the Performance Medallion and 20 points to earn the Performance Pin. Students must earn at least 6 of these 10 points, or 12 of the 20 points, from DEMTA sponsored events.  </li>
    <li>A DEMTA sponsored event is defined as any event (festival, recital or community connection) sponsored by Douglas-Elbert Music Teachers Association.  Each DEMTA-sponsored performance earns 2 points.  For a list of great events please see the calendar! </li>
    <li>The other 4 points can come from a teacher’s own studio recital or from a performance approved or planned by a teacher.  Teacher approved performances would include such things as church, school and community performances in which the student performs something that the teacher has personally worked with them to prepare.  </li>
    <li>Each recital or other approved performance earns 2 points. Major performance events will earn 4 points.  Major performances include such venues as our spring Music Festival, Guild, Federation and Sonatina Festivals, but of course, only DEMTA's Music Festival is a DEMTA sponsored event.  If a student should win a spot and perform on a follow-up recital/concert for a major performance event, the student would be awarded 2 additional points for that performance.  For example, a student who performed at DEMTA’s music festival would earn 4 points.  If he/she also performs at the Honors Concert – 2 additional points would then be awarded.</li>
